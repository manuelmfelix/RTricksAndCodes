# RTricksAndCodes
Codes I've created to solve problems I had along the way

## File: "read_protected_excel_file_including_comments"

Code to read the information of multiple sheets of a password protected excel files, including its comments.

## File: "get_website_info_rvest_RSelenium"

In this code you may find two different ways to get information from the www.codigos-postais.pt website.
The information I needed was the gps coordinates and street name of a list of postal codes.
I've made two different approaches, one using "rvest" and another using "RSelenium".
