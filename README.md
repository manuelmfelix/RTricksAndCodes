# RTricksAndCodes
Codes I've created to solve problems I had along the way

## File: "read_protected_excel_file_including_comments"

Code to read the information of multiple sheets of a password protected excel files, including its comments.

## File: "get_website_info_rvest_RSelenium"

In this code you may find two different ways to get information from the www.codigos-postais.pt website.
The information I needed was the gps coordinates and street name of a list of postal codes.
I've made two different approaches, one using "rvest" and another using "RSelenium".

## File: "googleMaps_Screenshot_ShinyApp"

The present code shows a Shiny App that interacts with the googlemaps api to get periodic screenshots of the chosen places with the chosen zooms.
In the app you can choose the days of the week to run the app, the time frame to run the app, the last day to run the app and there is the possibility to choose a more frequent period for the screenshots.

## File: "CP_website_info"

Code which uses Rvest and RSelenium to get Origin | Destination information (every schedule, price, trains, etc) from "Comboios de Portugal" website.
